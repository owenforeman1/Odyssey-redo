TODO:

Sounds page
- Write loop to create elements from sounds array
  - The display name needs to be extracted from the sound file link
  - Elements need to play their sound on click
  - on click, the elements should not link away to sounds, but rather play them on the page
- Page and elements shoudl have *some* CSS (like on-hover effect or on click effect). Feel free to get creative and remember "ancient Greece" style if you want
- There should be an A-Z quick menu at the top which link to lower sections of the page.
